# Scientific Programming - MSB1015 
## (academic year: 2023-2024)

This repository contains a Python notebook with the code for my project in the Scientific Programming course. 

The data used for this project can be found at Kaggle (this was originally from a Kaggle competition): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/data

The used data files were:
- train_proteins.csv
- train_peptides.csv
- train_clinical_data.csv

Python version 3.10.12 was used with the following libraries to run the code:
- Pandas (version 2.0.0)
- NumPy (version 1.23.5)
- Matplotlib (version 3.7.1)
- seaborn (version 0.12.2)
